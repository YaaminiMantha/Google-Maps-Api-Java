# Google-Maps-Api-Java

Implemented google maps api in java using spring mvc framework. When you execute the code it (i)finds the user location and displays the coordinates for latitude and longitude on map.

(ii) When the user types in address it displays the latitude and longitude on coordinates on map.

For this project I have created a dynamic web project and then converted it into Maven Project. In this project, I have
 1. Used the geocoder and geolocation api mainly in this project.

 2. Written a test case for checking if the expected coordinate values match the real values. For that I have provided the address and checked if the coordinate values matched.

 3. Tried finding the performance time or time taken to execute the code by including a start time and current time in  ServerLocationBoImpl.java file.

4. The google map api is called in ServerLocationBoImpl.java file.

I have executed the code in Tomcat Apache Server 7.0

localhost address to run the code:
http://localhost:8080/mitta-webapp/

Performance Number for the code is displayed in the console in Eclipse IDE.

Software Required:
-Eclipse IDE.
-Maven Integration for Eclipse.
-Apache Tomcat Server
